# **Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7 Extended Thinking Quickstart Colab Notebook**

This is a quick notebook to help you start experimenting with and learning about how to build with Sonnet 3.7

Important:

*   I did not write this code, I merely consolidated it into a Colab notebook to help make it a little more accessible for some to get up and running testing Sonnet 3.7

*   The code for this notebook was obtained from the Anthropic cookbook library, you can find the original code here: https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/extended_thinking

*   There are quite a few nuances to Sonnet 3.7 to begin learning about. As per the below evals, it's a pretty darn good coder.

It is also Anthropic's first reasoning model, and as a result introduces some new functionality like 'thinking blocks', redacted_thinking and cryptographic tokens. 

For more information on all of these I highly recommend that in addition to testing the below examples, you also check out the documentation here: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#how-extended-thinking-works
